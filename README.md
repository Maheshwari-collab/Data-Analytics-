Power BI Case Study:


Utilize Power Query to transform and clean the given dataset.
Handle missing or inconsistent data to ensure accurate analysis.
Join the different datasets as you deem necessary
Create as many columns as you'd like to join the tables to each other. Note that all columns need to be created using the Power Query ONLY:
Important KPI required:
Total sales (Sales â€“ Returns)
% Target Achieved
% Margin (Profit/Sales Amount)
Views
1. Sales performance with 4 sub-views (Overall view, Target/benchmark analysis, What if analysis and Pareto Analysis)
Showing sales trend for last 4 years and comparing current year to last, add KPIs and show split by segments, categories and by region
Target Achieved/Not Achieved: Highlight regions and states that have achieved their current year sales targets
What If: Take input from user for discount % in each segment and calculate the predicted Profit %.
Pareto : Build a pareto analysis and allow user the functionality to check what % of total sales are contributed by a chosen % of top customers
2. Customer analysis
Utilize. RFM (Recency(total sales amount in last 180 days), Frequency, and Monetary value) analysis to classify the customers into different segments like low valued, medium valued and high valued based on your own analysis. Assume the maximum date available in the data as the most recent date Develop visuals highlighting customer segments and their contribution % to sales. Include any relevant analysis.BONUS : Create a scoring metric system to identify potential customers for targeted marketing to increase sales and to retain existing customers.
Show how many new customers purchased from the clients in year 2021, what was their total sales amount, quantity purchased by them, and the discounts (amount) offered to them.
Find out the top 5 performing salesperson of the year for each segment at state level and city level. Show the total sales made by them as well as % average discount provided by them in each segment.
